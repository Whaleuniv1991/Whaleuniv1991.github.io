    <h1>Amritha Mandagondi</h1>
    <p>
I build high-impact programs and partnerships at the intersection of corporate social responsibility, workforce equity, and strategic communications.
With a systems-thinking mindset and deep on-the-ground experience, I help mission-driven teams turn bold ideas into scalable action‚Äîthrough effective program design, executive storytelling, and inclusive collaboration. My work spans continents, communities, and contexts‚Äîbut is always guided by the same core question:
üí° How do we build systems that truly serve the people they‚Äôre meant to?

üìç My Journey in Social Impact: A Timeline of Building with Purpose
üå± Community-Rooted Beginnings
South Asia ‚Äî 2012‚Äì2014
I began my career working alongside first-generation women entrepreneurs in rural South Asia‚Äîsupporting them to launch small-scale businesses rooted in hand-block printing, turmeric, and natural goods. I helped them make the leap from production to entrepreneurship, navigating new digital marketplaces and carving economic independence in traditionally informal economies.

üìö From Grassroots to the Classroom
Southeast Asia ‚Äî 2015‚Äì2017
Eager to work directly with young learners, I stepped into public school classrooms to teach English, math, and entrepreneurship to middle schoolers in under-resourced communities. These were students on the brink of dropping out‚Äîand together, we reimagined education as a platform for self-determined futures, not just test scores.

üíº Building Workforce Equity for Marginalized Youth
Asia + Global ‚Äî 2017‚Äì2019
I then led skills training and career readiness initiatives for youth with disabilities and early school leavers‚Äîdesigning inclusive programs that helped them access dignified jobs at companies like PepsiCo. These partnerships weren‚Äôt just about job placement; they were about shifting how systems viewed talent, potential, and inclusion.

üéÆ Scaling Learning Through Technology
Silicon Valley ‚Äî 2019‚Äì2021
At edtech startups in Silicon Valley, I translated my classroom insights into product strategy‚Äîdesigning gamified tools that made learning more human, engaging, and scalable. I championed learner voice and equity in every layer of the user experience, making educational technology work better for those most often left behind.

üõ†Ô∏è Leading Refugee Workforce Innovation
Bay Area ‚Äî 2021‚Äì2023
At the International Rescue Committee, I led economic mobility programs for refugee families from Afghanistan, Ukraine, Iran, El Salvador, and beyond. I designed cross-sector partnerships and ecosystem strategies that transformed fragmented services into coordinated, long-term pathways toward self-sufficiency.

üåç Strategic Program Design for Global Equity
Remote / Global ‚Äî 2023‚ÄìPresent
Now at Wevise, I lead strategy and partnerships for workforce equity pilots‚Äîbuilding inclusive learning systems, supporting underrepresented technologists, and collaborating with global teams to design programs grounded in impact, insight, and integrity.

‚ú® Across every chapter, I‚Äôve worked at the intersection of people and possibility‚Äîbridging systems and stories, values and action, urgency and equity.

üí¨ Open to consulting engagements, collaborations, and bold social impact projects where strategy meets purpose.
